## 💖 Heart Stroke Prediction by Ansh

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict the risk of heart stroke based on user inputs like age, gender, blood pressure, glucose level, smoking status, and other key health indicators.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an interactive web application using **Streamlit** that predicts whether a person is at risk of a heart stroke. The model was trained using real healthcare data, and the interface allows users to input values and get instant predictions.

## 🧠 Model Used

- Algorithm: **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- Preprocessing: StandardScaler and OneHotEncoder
- Evaluation Metric: Accuracy, Precision, Recall
- Saved Files:
  - `knn_heart_model.pkl`: Trained model
  - `heart_scaler.pkl`: Scaler used on numerical features
  - `heart_columns.pkl`: Column order for the input vector
## Performance Metrics
	•	Accuracy: 89%
	•	Confusion Matrix and ROC-AUC Curve provided in Notebook

## 📦 Requirements

Install the required libraries with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

## 📚 Future Improvements
	•	Add more ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
	•	Feature selection optimization
	•	Deploy via Hugging Face / Streamlit Cloud / Heroku
	•	Add user history tracking and PDF report generation

Let me know if you'd like:
- A version in **Hindi**
- Help adding images to your README
- A deploy guide (Streamlit Cloud / Hugging Face / Render)

Shall I convert this to a `.md` file and upload it?
